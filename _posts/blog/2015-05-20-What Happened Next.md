After accepting at [Flatiron](www.flatironschool.com), I had a week to send a $3,000 deposit to Flatiron to secure my spot. Then I started working through the [Flatiron Prework](http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/). A month ago, I was given a link to join a Facebook group, fill out a survey, and access the Flatiron prework program called **Learn**. Last week, I finished all of the prework. Seeing as I have 2.5 months until I attend Flatiron September 28th, I intend to work through as much of [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) as I can.
