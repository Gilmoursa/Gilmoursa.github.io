A Wisconsin project manager, a Florida video editor, a South Korean teacher, and now an aspiring web developer in the big apple. I've worn many hats in my lifetime and look forward to wearing yet another one: web developer.

In September, I fly 34 hours from South Korea, through the UAE and off to New York where I will begin learning everything the Flatiron School has to teach me about HTML/CSS, Ruby, SQL, Javascript, Rails, you name it.

I'll be using this blog to update my progress and hold myself accountable for the goals I set. After all, the best way to learn something new is to explain it to someone else. This blog will serve just that purpose.
